Skin Disease Classifier: A React based web platform for accurate skin condition classification using CNN model. Built with TensorFlow Keras, Kaggle dataset, Google Cloud deployment, TensorFlow Serving, and FastAPI

# Website
Project is deployed on github pages at
https://kumar-ranjith.github.io/skinDiseaseClassification/

# Training.ipynb
Training Notebook to load data from /DATA and model is trained using Tensorflow Keras. Model is trained, tested, and saved as skinDisease.h5

# Models
Stores the folder version of my model

# Frontend
Complete React web-app for the frontend UI of the application. The Image uploader calls the predict function in GCP by API. 

# API
Holds the base api used to test model deployment using Fast API and Flask

# GCP
Holds the Google Cloud Platform API script to deploy predict funtion to the GC Platform. Scipt is build using Flask.
